# Tag-based Random GIF Generator

The Tag-based Random GIF Generator is a React.js project that allows users to generate random GIFs based on a user-specified tag using the Giphy API. The application provides an interactive interface where users can input a tag (such as "developer"), fetch a random GIF related to that tag, and display it in the UI. The project includes the following key features:

API Integration: Fetches random GIFs from the Giphy API based on the entered tag.
Interactive Input: Users can enter a tag to generate a related GIF.
Loading Spinner: Displays a spinner while the GIF is being fetched.
Dynamic Updates: Automatically updates the displayed GIF with each new tag input or on button click.
